Q: How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

A: First it gave me a window into the world of the tools a front-web developer uses, and second it shown me how easy it can be to compare two files using the right tools.

Q: How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

A: We can make errors that can be corrected by going back to the original version, or we can even review our work flow as well with this tools

Q: What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

A:The pros are, you wont have too many history versions of one file, and you can decide when is important to do so.

The cons are, you can forget to commit when you should have done it, and you can lose work if your computer crashes before you commit.


Q: Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

A: This are tools developed specially for programming, where multiple files are interelated.

Q: How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

A: First I use the command git log to see the amount of commits in a specific project, then I can compare different commits by using the command git diff

Q: How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

A: Now I can try new things without being too worried about introducing a bug that will be really hard to find in big projects, for example.

Q: Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

A: I would like to be able to connect to my GitHub account online
