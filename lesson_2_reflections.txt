Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: It initalize the repository and it shows it as empty and the location of it. 
We need to do it to create a .git file on it, and start recordin history and be able to commit to any new changes

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is the place in between the repository and the working directory, it holds the files before we can commit to any changes. 

I think it holds changes and records them befor commiting to them.
